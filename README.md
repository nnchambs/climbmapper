# climbmapper

An experiment built on Node.js using Mountain Project climbing route data and my climbing area data.

You can see the app live at www.climbmapper.com

## Why Port To React?
Because the initial implementation was a proof of concept and experiment.  I would like to re-build with better tools and better features so the app is more useful for others and developers are more excited to contribute.  I want this to be an app by the people and for the people.


## Contributer Notes
I am slowly moving all the JavaScript/JQuery code to React in the reactify branch.  Currently I have all the code that is already (or is in progress of being) ported in the 'app' directory in the project root. We can extract this out later but I wanted to isolate React specific implementations from the legacy.
